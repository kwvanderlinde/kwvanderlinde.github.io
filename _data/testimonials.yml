    I am not exaggerating when I say MapTool is the most flexible, powerful, and accessible virtual tabletop in the
    world. It handles everything I need it to, from improvised, rapid white-board style gaming to carefully crafted,
    immersive encounters which include dynamic lighting, animated weather effects, audio feedback, and interactive map
    features. The standard features are extensive, and the scripting language and community add-ons make incredible
    things possible.

    MapTool is reliable, responsive, and powerful. The user community is world-class and the development team is highly
        active and collaborative. On top of it all, MapTool is open source, always free, and has durably served gaming
        groups for over 15 years - it is battle tested, and going strong. What more can you ask for?

    I discovered MapTool around 12 years ago back in 2009. All I was looking for was a program to show maps and to move
    tokens around on that map for an in-person game, but what I discovered was a whole lot more. What really stood out
    to me was how helpful and friendly the community was. I'm still here and returning the favour for all those new
    macro writers who are building our community.

    I'm upgrading to a new laptop, and as I was downloading the latest version of Token Tool, it occurred to me that I
    should give y'all some love. I've used Token Tool for many months with my online TTRPGs, and it just works. No
    headaches, no glitche. It just does what I need it to do. I really appreciate that. Great work, guys!

    I discovered MapTool. After watching the tutorial videos, I was in. I had the time of my life creating a PF1e
    framework (game system) for MapTool. Each MapTool release was extremely stable and created no problems for my
    macros. The MapTool developers were very responsive to my needs. Each MapTool version was loaded with new features
    that enhanced my group's game play. The MapTool community is so friendly and helpful I'd almost call it a family.
