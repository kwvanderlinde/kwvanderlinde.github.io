MTScript is a custom language for writing MapTool macros which grew out of MapTool's chat functionality. It began simply enough as a way to roll dice. It
expanded over time to the point where users create custom gaming frameworks and convenience functions in MapTool to be used by GMs and Players alike. To get a
hint of what mtScript can do, check out the [User Creations]({{ site.data.links.forums | escpape }}viewforum.php?f=8) topic in the MapTool forum. To see
MTScript taken to the Nth degree see [Wolph42's Bag of Tricks]({{ site.data.links.forums | escpape }}viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=16066) which encapsulates extreme
MTScripting. You'll find support for complete RPG frameworks for a huge number of games systems in [Campaign Frameworks]({{ site.data.links.forums | escpape }}viewforum.php?f=33).

The MapTool macro editor is a little lacking in functionality so the community stepped up to create tools for editing. It's one of the strengths of this
group, the desire to contribute when and where they can. There are at least two community gems out there that allow for easy editing and syntax checking for
Macros.

<a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="float-left" src="/assets/img/vimlogo.svg" alt="vim_header" width="60" height="45"></a>The first is Craig's GVIM configuration. You can find download and installation instructructions at this [forum link]({{ site.data.links.forums | escape }}viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=5764). GVIM is the descendant of the venerable VI editor. People either love or hate VI. It uses one or two character commands and is very powerful. You almost never need to touch the mouse once you get use to it. To get over VI's learning curve we suggest reading [vimbook-OPL.pdf](https://www.truth.sk/vim/vimbook-OPL.pdf). Azhrei also produced a [quick reference sheet](https://www.eeconsulting.net/business/vi.pdf). GVIM runs on Windows, Mac, Linux.

Notepad++ is more user friendly and is closer to the editors most users know. However, it only runs on Windows operating systems or a system in Windows emulation mode, such as Linux Wine.

The tool is actually written in MTScript and allows for macro configuration and button display properties.

You can find the files and full instructions on this [forum link]({{ site.data.links.forums | escape }}viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=25531). Besides editing, you can also put your macros under source code control by saving them out to github or sourceforge.

If you decide to take the plunge into Macro writing, visit the [Introduction to Macro Writing]({{ site.data.links.wiki }}/index.php/Introduction_to_Macro_Writing) on the RPTools Documentation Wiki. If you get stuck head over to the [MapTool-&gt;Macros]({{ site.data.links.forums }}viewforum.php?f=20) topic in the RPTools forum for help.
