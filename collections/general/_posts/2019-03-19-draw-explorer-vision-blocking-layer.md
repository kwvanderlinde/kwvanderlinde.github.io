With the introduction of Maptool 1.5 comes a series of additions to the Draw Explorer that should speed map creation. If you draw your dungeon rooms directly in Maptool, you can now build the Vision Blocker Layer in a few simple clicks.  Imagine you had built the dungeon shown below entirely with textures (not images):

<img class="post-example" src="/assets/img/map1.webp" alt="map1" width="300">

You now want to add the vision blocking layer. So your first step is to cover the entire map with a solid vision blocking rectangle:

<img class="post-example" src="/assets/img/map2.webp" alt="map2" width="300">

Now you simply open the Draw Explorer by clicking **Window > Draw Explorer.**

Then select all of the rooms, right click and select **Shape to VBL > Remove from VBL**

<img class="post-example" src="/assets/img/map3.webp" alt="map3" width="300">

Your vision layer is complete. The job is done!

<img class="post-example" src="/assets/img/map4.webp" alt="map4" width="300">

#### Path vs. Shape

The menu contains two options for adding/removing VBL: Path and Shape

- Path is the outer border of the drawing. Use this if you to add or remove VBL lines from the edges of your drawings.
- Shape includes or removed the entire drawing to/from VBL. Use it to replicate the use case above.

#### Limitations

You currently cannot use either the Path or Shape to VBL for the Oval drawing type.
