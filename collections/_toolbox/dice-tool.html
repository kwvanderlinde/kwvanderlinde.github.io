<p>We came up with <strong>DiceTool</strong> while GMing. There were frequent multi-dice rolls and determining the result was slow sometimes.  We looked at and
tried many of the fine dice rolling apps out there, but they all lacked features we wanted (such as saving complicated expressions for re-rolling) or had
features we didn’t care for (such as the mechanic of picking up and throwing the dice using the mouse).</p>
