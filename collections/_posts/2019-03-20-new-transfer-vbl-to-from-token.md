MapTool 1.5 allows the transfer Vision Blocking Layer (VBL) to and from tokens. To access this new capability, simply edit a token and go to the VBL tab.

There are several options on the VBL tab. You can generate VBL to cover the token. However, depending on the type of token, this can create complex VBL that will slow down vision rendering during a game.

To create simpler VBL, you can now draw the VBL over the token on the map and transfer it to the token. You can then copy, move, or save the token and the VBL will remain. In the image below I’ve drawn an X with the VBL tools then transferred it onto the token.

A few other notes about this panel.

- Visible Over FOW indicates that the token can always be seen over the Fog of War but still respects vision. However, if you have vision turned off on the map (Map->Vision-Off) the token will be visible regardless of VBL.
- The VBL Sensitivity determines what level of image transparency respected when generate the VBL for the token. The levels run from 1 to 255. The higher the number the more transparency is revealed.
- Visibility Tolerance determines how much of the token is seen before the entire token is revealed. If you imagine the token divided into a 3×3 grid, the Visibility Tolerance is the number of those segments that must be visible to the observing token before the entire token is made visible.
