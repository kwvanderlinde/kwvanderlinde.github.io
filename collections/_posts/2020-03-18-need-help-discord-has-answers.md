RPTools products are open source gaming products. Being open source, they’ve had multiple contributors throughout the years with documentation, forum posts, and tutorials provided by our ever-growing community. At times the sheer volume of information can be off-putting.

If you’re trying to find answers to a problem, locate a resource or join the community in discussing new functionality then the fastest way is via our live chat server on [Discord]({{ site.data.links.discord | escape }}). The server is populated with people from around the globe willing and able to assist newbies and veterans alike.

Discord has a web version and apps for most operating systems. You will need to create a login if you don’t already have one.

Our Discord server has Announcements, Sharing, Scripting, Support, and Contributing channels for you to find answers and offer support. Discord also supports voice chat should that be needed and we have a few gaming channels open if you don’t have a voice solution to your remote games.

Other support avenues include the [forums]({{ site.data.links.forums | escape }}), our [wiki]({{ site.data.links.wiki | escape }}), and [GitHub]({{ site.data.links.github | escape }}). The forums contain a huge set of searchable posts that covers many versions of RPTools products. GitHub houses our current and past logged issues as well as where they sit within the development process. The Wiki contains our documentation.

So hop on over to our Discord server and start chatting. You don’t need an issue, just the desire to interact with other RPTools users. Read you there!

You can download available versions of MapTool from [GitHub](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/releases/latest).

All users running versions prior to 1.8.3 are strongly encouraged to update. See [this announcement post](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=29314) on our forum.

A JAR file version may be downloaded as well but is only recommended for developers or other advanced users.

Mac Users are encouraged to use the PKG version of the install. Windows users are encouraged to use the MSI.

If you need interactive help, please join our [Discord Server]({{ site.data.links.discord | escape }}). Or visit our [wiki]({{ site.data.links.wiki | escape }}) for complete walk-throughs of how to use the tool. Our Community page has more links; see the toolbar at the top of the page.
