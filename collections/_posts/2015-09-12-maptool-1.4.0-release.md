We’re proud to announce the release of MapTool 1.4.0, creating a revitalization of MapTool development methodologies and direction. The MapTool application
began life in 2005 when three programmers started an open source Java project as a way to connect remote friends for their RPG. It has grown in features and
functionality over the last decade to include capabilities suggested by and implemented by its users but retains the goal of bringing gamers together. MapTool
will always be free and supported by people that love RPGs and willingly give back to the gaming community.

This build represents a great deal of backend work to move the source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/RPTools), implements a new program build methodology
using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), and the initial implementation of server-side capabilities the will greatly increase the extensibility of the MapTool
feature set going forward. Unfortunately you, as the user, won’t notice much of that as you run your game but it does set up the application to introduce new
features with greater ease.

Now, for what you will notice:<br>
We’ve introduce isometric maps in this release which can greatly enhance height and depth visualization for your dungeon.

For more information on isometric maps, please visit Jagged’s [forum topic](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=26036) on the subject.

For you macro coders we’ve added the following new functions:
<ul>
    <li>Set view area macro command</li>
    <li>Add setTokenWidth/Height macro functions</li>
    <li>Add setZoom(x) and getZoom() macro functions</li>
</ul>

Other changes include
<ul>
    <li>Default the “Rename Map” input dialog</li>
    <li>Refactor SightType and Light to use same shape code from Grid class</li>
    <li>Change boundary to be boundary of cell and adjust image boundary instead</li>
    <li>Improved random suffix logic</li>
    <li>Fixes for stylesheet removal issues in htmlframe/form with Java 1.7 and up</li>
    <li>New right-click menu option on Stamps to allow user to select a pixel range and enter the number of cells/squares in the selection</li>
    <li>German Language Updates</li>
    <li>Start of a WebAPI</li>
    <li>Full Java 8 compatibility</li>
</ul>

Those last two bullets are some of the most important. These are down-in-the-technical-weeds features that set up MapTool for great things going forward.
