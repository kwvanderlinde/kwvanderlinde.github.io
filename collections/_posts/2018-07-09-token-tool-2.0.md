RPTools is proud to announce a new version of TokenTool, Rewritten in JavaFX to bring a modern and updated UI as well as a few new features! TokenTool 2.0 now supports PSD format for ‘overlays’ to allow for better masking by supporting ‘layers’. To create your own ‘overlay’ you can use any version of PhotoShop or GIMP and add your masking layer as the first (bottom) layer and your overlay image as the second (top) layer.

This release represents a critical milestone for RPTools development. For those of you interested in a bit of history and some technical details, the original RPTools products user interfaces are written using Java Swing. While Swing is still part of Java, Oracle stopped making enhancements to it a long while back. Some developers left the RPTools project as they felt they were working on a project without enhancing their core skills. As a reminder, RPTools is Open Source software with volunteer developers who work for free. One of the benefits of working on RPTools products is the experience gained from a large and complex code base.

Thus to move to JavaFX for TokenTool will pave the way for moving MapTool to JavaFX. This is a good thing.

The summary of benefits to the new TokenTool are summarized below.

- Over 150 Overlays
- Ability to rotate via shift-mouse wheel
- New ‘Use as Base’ feature for Overlays
- Tree/folder organization for Overlays
- Touch support (for you touchscreen users)
- Better drag/drop support
- The ability to copy image or image URL from the browser and paste into TokenTool!
- All settings saved on exit
- Last 10 overlays used saved as Recent for quick access
- Embedded JRE with native OS installer
 
The new TokenTool has the ability to manage overlays from within the tool. You can now create and edit them directly and it now supports photoshop PSD files.
