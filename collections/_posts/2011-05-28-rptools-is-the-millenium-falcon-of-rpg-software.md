        <p markdown="1">RPTools is a brand of open-source programs designed to enhance traditional pen-and-paper role-playing games. You use them for
        face-to-face or Internet role-playing in real time – even if your players are on the other side of the world.  [MapTool](/toolbox/maptool/), our
        flagship product, is a free, highly-customizable virtual tabletop usable for a wide variety of gaming systems, from fantasy to sci-fi; from tabletop
        miniatures games to purely spoken-word games. [TokenTool](/toolbox/token-tool) is nearly as popular and can be used for a variety of VTTs or custom maps
        using simple drag-and-drop images from the web or your computer system.</p>
