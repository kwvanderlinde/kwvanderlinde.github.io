The RPTools Staff and Community are proud to announce the release of MapTool 1.5.1. This release contains bug fixes as well as a few functional bits that didn’t
make it into 1.5.0. You can find the full [1.5.1 Changelog](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG.md) on our GitHub site.

Note: if you installed 1.5.0 you may not need to download the new version. The next time you start 1.5.0 it should ask you if you want the new version. If you
say ‘yes’, it should download 1.5.1 for you in a location you pick. Once downloaded you’ll still need to install it.

Some new features include:

- A new macro function to get the native [height](https://wiki.rptools.info/index.php/getTokenNativeHeight) and [width](https://wiki.rptools.info/index.php/getTokenNativeWidth)
  of a token.
- A new macro function to [get the current view area size](https://wiki.rptools.info/index.php/getViewArea). Please note: *this function is the subject of debate as to
  its return values. You might want to wait until 1.5.2 before using it.*
- You can now use the delete key to remove assets from the Draw and Map Explorer. It doesn’t ask first so be careful!
- You can now add multiple color rings for personal light. An example would be: Darkvision: circle scale r60#FF0000 r100#00FF00

- You now get a preview of the token opacity on the Edit Token->Config tab.

- You can now have fractional cell units on maps.

- Closing MapTool while the window is maximized no longer causes problems on the next startup with parts of MapTool hanging off the screen.

Special thanks to one of our new developers naciron for jumping in and making a big splash. He did most, if not all of the new feature work on this release.
