There was a bug regarding default overlays and a bug in the file-type selection for saving tokens that have been fixed as part of this release. Please see the
[TokenTool 2.2.0](https://www.rptools.net/2021/07/token-tool-2-2-released/) release post for new features and updates.

You can download the new version of TokenTool from the following link:

<https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/releases/tag/2.2.1>

A JAR file version may be downloaded as well but is only recommended for developers or other advanced users.

Mac Users are encouraged to use the PKG version of the install. Windows users are encouraged to use the MSI.
