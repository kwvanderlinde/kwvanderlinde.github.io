The RPTools staff is proud to announce the release of TokenTool 2.1. Many thanks to @jamz for all his hard work on this release.

Changes include:

- PDF Extraction &ndash; Open and extract images straight from the module! Using the File -> Open PDF menu or dragging a PDF to the main window, you can open and view a PDF. The individual images are shown to the right and you can either drag them to the main window or left-click with the mouse to use the image as the Portrait or right-click with the mouse to use the image as the background.
- Arrow Key Nudges &ndash; You can use the arrow keys as well as the number pad to nudge the images 1 pixel at a time! Be sure you have the layer selected that you want to move.
- CI Config and Java Updates &ndash; The packaged JRE has been bumped up to Oracle JDK 10 and is now the required JRE if launching the JAR manually.
- User-supplied Background Images &ndash; In addition to a background color, you can now supply a background image! When dragging images to the main window, drop zones will highlight and the “Layer” button in the upper right will tell you if you are setting the Portrait or Background image. Several options have been added to support the use of backgrounds as well.
- Keyboard Shortcut for Screen Capture &ndash; Several keyboard shortcuts, as well as Accelerators, have been added to the various menu items.
- Screen Capture Box Size Retention &ndash; The screen capture window now remembers its size! In fact, all the windows now remember their size and position!
- ESC Key Now Cancels Screen Capture. Didn’t mean to capture that screenshot? Pressing the ESC key will now cancel the action and close the window.
- Settings Restore &ndash; A new menu option under Help -> Reset Settings will restore all settings to their defaults.
- New Overlays
- Unlock Aspect Ration &ndash; If you unlock the aspect ratio (pressing the padlock on the Overlay Options), you can now set the token size to an integer.
- The overlay’s original width x height is now displayed under the Overlays name on the Overlay Options panel.
- New Save Options &ndash; Save options were expanded to allow you to save the Portrait used (with or without Background color/image) alongside the token. This is useful if you grabbed the image from a URL or PDF and forgot or couldn’t save it. Also, if you save with Background Options, it will save the portrait as a .jpg instead of a .png (which are typically 10x smaller in disk space) so you can use that high-quality PNG from the PDF to create a token but use a smaller jpg for the Portrait (say, in MapTool) where transparency is probably not needed or wanted.

Excited about the new functionality? Let’s discuss in the comments below or on one of our many social outlets.
