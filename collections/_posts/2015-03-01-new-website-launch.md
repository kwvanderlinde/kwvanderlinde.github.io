        <p markdown="1">Welcome to RPTools new website. We hope you find the new site cleaner, slicker, and easier to navigate. We’ve added a group of quick
        links to the sidebar and reorganized the pages a bit including links to the [forums]({{ site.data.links.forums | escape }}),
        [Wiki]({{ site.data.links.wiki | escape }}), user-created frameworks, online communities, and other helpful links to get new users started. We hope you
        find it more user friendly.</p>
        <p markdown="1">The strength of RPTools has ever been its community and the goal of the new website will be to highlight that strength. Expect updates
        to the main page that will show interesting posts on the forum, examples of the tool’s users in actual play, and helpful videos of the tools in use. The
        goal is to make rptools.net a place to come to for more than just downloads. We hope to provide useful information to both the long-time user and the
        person trying to decide which VTT is right for them.</p>

## Website Still Improving

We have a strong international community and one of the early goals of the new site was to provide content in various languages in order to improve the
experience for our non-native English speakers. It is still a goal but may take a bit of time to achieve. Thanks to everyone that provided translation support.
RPTools software is free, open source, and open community. We try never to build artificial walls around development, testing, or content. Our goal of providing
multilingual support is just another facet of that belief.
