This release corrects a few small bugs affecting isometric map ‘figure’ stamps along with a fix for Draw Tool images. This is likely the last version of the 1.4.0.x series and represents our latest production release. Please upgrade as soon as practical.

**Bugfixes**

- Resize free size figure tokens (Jagged)
- Fixes for Z-Order on free sized objects (Jagged)
- Fixes for resizing stamps that are type “figure” (Jagged)
- Small iso fixes (Jagged)
- Fix for Missing images (Jamz)

MapTool can be acquired from the [Download Page](/toolbox/maptool) of RPTools.net.
