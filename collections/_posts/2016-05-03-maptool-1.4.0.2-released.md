This was a quick release to fix the tableImage() image issue which surfaced in MapTool build 1.4.0.1. This release also adds capabilities to modify the max recursion depth in function calls.

Thanks to Jagged for the quick turn around time on the bug and Craig for the recursion limit change and build.

Please see the [Announcements thread](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=26631&p=262942#p262942) for more details. You can find the new release on
