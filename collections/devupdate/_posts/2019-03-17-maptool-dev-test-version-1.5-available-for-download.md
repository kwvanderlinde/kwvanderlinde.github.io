The RPTools team is proud to announce the release of MapTool 1.5 which includes a number of new features to make your in-game RPG experience better from campaign design to game night. The [Github changelog](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG.md) contains a complete list of changes.

This release merges the JamzTheMan’s [Nerps](https://maptool.nerps.net/) branch into the main RPTools branch bringing with it [Hero Lab and PDF integration](/2019/03/new-resource-library-file-type-support-por-and-pdf/). Also included is a new [Macro editor](/2019/03/new-macro-editor/) with syntax highlighting and code completion, [terrain modifiers](/2019/03/pathfinding-vbl-and-terrain/), [Draw Explorer](/2019/03/draw-explorer-vision-blocking-layer/) enhancements, a new Whisper function from the connections window, and many, many more.

A major change from MapTool 1.4 is the removal of the MapTool Launcher and the inclusion of a [packaged Java](/2019/03/maptool-1-5-comes-bundled-with-java/) with the release. This means you’ll no longer need to keep your system’s java maintained in order to run MapTool. This should be a great enhancement for those who ‘just want things to work.’

Another major change in the way we develop and deploy MapTool is the creation of a continuous integration (CI) system. Enabling CI means it will be easier to build and deploy MapTool so, in theory, we’ll have shortened development/release cycles so functionality donated by our [contributors](/contributors/) will reach you sooner. The new CI for MapTool also means it will be easier to accept patches from new contributors.

RPTools has also implemented a new [Code of Conduct](/contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct/) for the community. While we’ve always been a polite crowd, the CoC will give us something to point to when discussions become intense.

We’ll discuss the new features in the coming days on this site until we make it through all the new stuff.
